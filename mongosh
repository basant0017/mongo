Access the MongoDB shell:
mongosh
Switch to the MongoDB admin database:

use admin
Create a user with ‘userAdminAnyDatabase‘ permissions:
db.createUser(
{
user: "zabbix_mon",
 pwd: "zabbix_mon",
roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
 }
 );


===================
use admin

db.createUser({
  user: "testUser",
  pwd: "password",
  roles: [
    { role: "readWrite", db: "<your_database>" }
  ]
})



MongoDB 6.0.1

bindIp: 127.0.0.1;192.168.1.0
After change just restart mongodb server:

sudo systemctl restart mongod


# network interfaces
net:
  port: 27017
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1, <your_server_ip>
  bindIpAll: true


 verify the connection write bellow code in your local system terminal

nc -zv <your_server_ip> 27017



==============
In your case you need to follow the following steps.

Setup the remote machine to block all connections to port 27017
Enable remote machine to only accept connections from your local machine
Setup credentials with MongoDB
Connect with client using credentials.

If you are not sure how to do any of this steps. Check out a blog post that I wrote that goes more in details how to do this.
